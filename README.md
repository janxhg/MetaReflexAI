## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to build a **metacognitive system that allows AI models to observe, analyze, and adjust their own learning processes**. Through a cycle of introspection and modification, models can evolve autonomously during training.

Initial tests have yielded **functional models**, even though they're not yet optimal. Notably, the entire process runs on **low-cost hardware (GTX 1650 + 16 GB RAM)** with **surprisingly fast training times**.

## 🧠 Purpose: Real Acceleration & Self-Improvement

The goal is not just faster training, but to enable **models that understand and improve themselves**. This includes:

* Introspective reasoning
* Parameter self-adjustment
* Real-time performance analysis during training

## 📈 Early Results

* ✔️ Functional models already working
* 🖥️ Trained on low-cost hardware (GTX 1650, 16 GB RAM)
* ⚡ Training completed in record times
* 🔧 Models are not yet optimal, but improve as they train

## 🔄 Metacognitive Cycle

| Stage            | Purpose                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Observation**  | Analyze internal model state                 |
| **Reflection**   | Generate hypotheses and learning insights    |
| **Modification** | Change parameters, architecture, or behavior |
| **Repetition**   | Cycle repeats throughout training            |

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone (soon)
cd metacognitive-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 💡 Next Steps

* Refine reflection and self-adjustment mechanisms
* Improve model awareness of overfitting
* Integrate deeper attention and activation analysis
